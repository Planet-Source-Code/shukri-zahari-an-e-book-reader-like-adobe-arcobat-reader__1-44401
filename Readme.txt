Introduction

Have you ever used Adobe Acrobat to view PDF files? Well, that for PDF. This is a program that look like Adobe Acrobat but it is used to read plain text (maybe next version will support something great :-) This program took me 30 minutes to finished it & another 1 hour to debug it. It have nice GUI (Graphical User Interface) & some great features.



Credit

My credit goes to myself as the coder of this program & to J. Kelly Jr. for his File Packer / File Binder submission. Without his great submission, I will not able to make this program on my own. Hey, Kelly!!! Sorry to use your code w/o permission :-P All dude out there, please vote me & Kelly, OK??!!!


PS: To create "books" for my application, you can use the modified version of J. Kelly Jr.'s File Binder program.
PS: Actually, this program can be run by command-line, but I'm to lazy to do it, so feel free to add it yourself
